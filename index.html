                <p>Robotics is an
                    interdisciplinary field that merges engineering, computer science, and technology to create machines
                    capable of performing various tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. These robots are
                    often programmed to perform specific tasks, such as assembling products on a factory line, assisting
                    in
                    surgeries, or even exploring distant planets. Robotics has opened new possibilities for industries,
                    healthcare, exploration, and personal use, leading to innovation in sectors that previously relied
                    heavily on manual labor. <br><br>In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence, machine

                    perform tasks with precision, speed, and endurance beyond human capabilities, such as welding,
                    painting, assembling, and
                    packaging
                    <br><br>In addition to reducing production time and costs, industrial robots can work in hazardous
                    environments where human safety might be at risk, such as in handling toxic materials or working in
                    axtrume temperatures. As the demand for mass production grows, robots are becoming essential for
                    maintaining the bace and quality required in modern manufacturing. The future of industrial robots
                    includes increased collaboration between robots and humans, with robots assisting workers in complex
